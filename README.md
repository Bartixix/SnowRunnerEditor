**THIS APP IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION AND IS INCOMPLEATED, YOU CAN GIVE ME IDEAS ON FEATURES TO ADD. THIS README IS AN EXPLENATION OF THIS APP'S TARGET AND PLANNED FEATURES. CURRENTLY ONLY `initial.pak` REPACKING WORKS, IF YOU WRITE THE DIRECTORIES DIRECTLY INTO THE CODE.**
# About
This is a desktop application designed to modify the `initial.pak` file inside of your `SnowRunner's` directory. It is ment to be a simple way to add and modify existing trucks without creating actual mods.
# What is `initial.pak`
It is a file containing all of `SnowRunner's` confings, truck data, language data, cargo data and much more. It is a `.zip` file, which has been structured for the game's needs. In simple words you can't make it with `7z` or `winrar`.
# Why patch the game instead of creating a mod?
To my knowladge, it is imposible to modify any in-game trucks with ordinary mods. You can create modded copies of existing trucks and add features to them, but sometimes if you want to modify a lot of different things you can end up with a lot of duplicate trucks.
# Current alternative to this app
You can use [SnowRunnerPakTool](https://github.com/Bartixix/SnowRunnerTools), but it requires manual modification of `.xml` game files, which may be a pain if you don't know the language syntax.
